# Cloud Migration - Default Configuration

# These values are derived from the MVP config that worked well.
# All parameters are locked per the approved plan - modify with caution.

# Embedding model for sentence encoding
embedding_model: "all-mpnet-base-v2"

# Device for model inference: "cpu", "cuda", or "auto"
# Use "cpu" for local testing, "cuda" for GPU instances in cloud
device: "cpu"

# UMAP dimensionality reduction parameters

  metric: "euclidean"
  cluster_selection_method: "leaf"

# CountVectorizer parameters for topic representation
# ngram_range: Use unigrams and bigrams for richer topic representation
# min_df: Minimum document frequency (conservative for small firm corpora)
vectorizer:
  ngram_range: [1, 2]
  min_df: 2

# Representation model parameters for topic labeling
# mmr_diversity: Higher = more diverse keywords (0.0-1.0)
# pos_model: SpaCy model for part-of-speech filtering
representation:
  mmr_diversity: 0.3
  pos_model: "en_core_web_sm"

# Theme validation parameters
validation:
  # Tier 1: Minimum firms required for a valid theme
  min_firms: 2
  # Tier 2: Maximum topic share from single firm (0.4 = 40%)

# GPU Note: For GPU acceleration (future), use cuML's HDBSCAN and UMAP:
#   from cuml.cluster import HDBSCAN
#   from cuml.manifold import UMAP
# Set device: "cuda" and ensure cuML is installed.
